  """Gravity (affiliate)
Gravity is a React and Node based boilerplate that is used by over 500 developers. It's been around since 2019 and was created by Kyle Gawley. I interviewed Kyle on YouTube about why he ditched VC startups because of stress and how he came to bootstrapping.

There's actually a free version of Gravity, but it comes without a lot of the functionality like payments. Something I like about Gravity is that it gives you the choice of 10 different databases to connect to instead of making you choose one the boilerplate maker likes. Randall Kanna, a popular self-taught developer, sold her AI app CodeTutor after using Gravity to build it.

Unlike some of the other boilerplates on this list, there are 4 different pricing options. If you pay more than the basic price, you also get a React Native codebase. Everyone who buys Gravity gets access to the Discord community, which is nice, as that way you can get tips from devs who use it.""",

""""NextJS SaaS boilerplates
ShipFast (affiliate)
Built by the popular and charismatic Frenchman Marc Lou, ShipFast promises to get your SaaS up and running FAST! It's a boilerplate for using the popular NextJS framework and comes with features like email, authentication and your choice of MongoDB or Supabase for your database. It has over 4,000 users at present.

The thing I like about this one is that Marc provides a really good landing page template with a great copywriting boilerplate that you can tailor to your own SaaS.

Another thing that I love about this SaaS boilerplate is how Marc Lou has gamified the boilerplate experience. He's built a leaderboard of the apps created with ShipFast in order of revenue they generate so you can compete with other founders. It is also a great way to get publicity boost for your SaaS because other builders and visitors to the site see your app. It's also a way to get backlink from a website with a high domain reputation (65/100).""",

""""supastarter (affiliate)
The supastarter template is a boilerplate for NextJS and Nuxt and boasts over 400 users. Buyers have the choice of buying access to build their app in either NextJS 14 or Nuxt 3. SupaStarter includes pages for outlining your app's terms and conditions/privacy policies, which can be important for European devs.

Something that's great about Supa Starter is you get lifetime updates after you buy it. So whenever the boilerplate is modified and improved, you can benefit."""

"""Marblism
Marblism is an AI-powered website generater created by Ulric Musset and Cyril Pluche. The idea is that you give it a prompt and it generates a TypeScript web app for you in a few minutes! So you don't have to do any of the initial design or things like naming database tables. Although you can use Marblism to create a SaaS, you can also make other things like internal tools or marketplaces.

Marblism comes with features like Stripe payments, Next Auth, a postgres database and an integration with OpenAI for making AI apps. Rather uniquely for a boilerplate like this, you can also host your website on Marblism as well with one-click. This is a nice feature if you don't want to set up your own server. There's no vendor lock-in - all your code is in GitHub so you can host it anywhere you like.""",

At the moment Divjoy offers templates for a SaaS or a landing page (Web3 and e-commerce templates are coming soon). Also, you can use it for as many projects as you like! Some boilerplates restrict this.

Saving time from doing repetitive actions brings a special kind of satisfaction, and boilerplates allow you to do exactly that. Boilerplates refer to content (text or code) that can be reused without much or any change. SaaS boilerplates help you ship your SaaS application in a faster and possibly better way too.

This article will cover all you need to know about SaaS boilerplates. To help you choose the right SaaS boilerplate, I’ve also covered ten of my favourite boilerplates, too, but first, let’s start with what they are.

SaaS Boilerplates
SaaS boilerplates refer to pre-built codebases that support features common in SaaS applications. These features are usually the ones you see in most web and mobile applications — that is, user authentication, subscription management, billing systems, and so on.

It’s easy to underestimate how long these things will take to do, and morale can drop when you realize enough time has passed and you’re still working on these somewhat mundane tasks. Instead of building such features yourself, using a SaaS boilerplate can save time and give you a massive jump start.

Aside from saving time, boilerplates also help developers focus on the main point of the app — similar to how startup founders are encouraged to not get caught up in bookkeeping but instead to focus on the product. Developers can skip building common features and start building their app’s core functionalities earlier with boilerplates.

It sounds great, but what’s the catch? Well, they aren’t a fit for everybody. The following sections will help you decide if they’re good for you.

Do note that not all boilerplates are created equal quality-wise, so while talking about the benefits and cons of boilerplates, I’m considering a standard, reputable SaaS boilerplate. But worry not, as I list things to consider when choosing the right SaaS boilerplate, too.

Benefits of SaaS Boilerplates
Aside from accelerating development and saving both time and money, using a SaaS boilerplate can have the following benefits:

Focus on core value. Developers can concentrate on building the core features of their SaaS application that differentiate the product rather than reinventing the wheel with common functionalities. They can save development time.
Best practices. Boilerplates are often designed with the latest industry standards in mind, adopting secure and efficient coding practices that have been proven over time.
Easier maintenance and updates. Since boilerplates often follow standardized coding practices and are well-documented, maintaining and updating the application becomes more straightforward.
Faster time to market. Beyond just the speed of initial development, using a boilerplate can lead to a faster time to market for new features and updates. This agility can be a key factor in competitive markets where being first or quick to adapt can define success.
Scalability. SaaS boilerplates are generally designed with scalability in mind, offering codebases and infrastructure setups that support growth. They’re a great way to develop multi-tenant applications.
Community and support. Many boilerplates come with access to a community of developers and documentation, which is helpful for both troubleshooting and learning.
Ideal users for SaaS boilerplates
Considering the above benefits, the following would benefit greatly:

Startup founders and entrepreneurs. For those aiming to launch their product quickly to validate business ideas or capture market opportunities​​.
Freelance developers, small to medium-sized teams. Devs or teams that need to maximize resource efficiency and focus on delivering innovative features rather than foundational functionalities​​.
Rapid prototyping needs. When the goal is to quickly prototype a concept for feedback, boilerplates offer a fast track to a working model.
Developers improving their craft. A great resource for learning through practical application and getting up to speed with the best coding practices. But try to use only the free SaaS boilerplates for this purpose.
Cons of SaaS Boilerplates
Despite their advantages, SaaS boilerplates come with certain drawbacks that can make them less than ideal for some projects:

Generic solutions. Boilerplates provide a one-size-fits-all solution that may not meet the specific needs or requirements of more specialized projects.
Unnecessary bloat. Boilerplates can include features and code that are not needed for a particular project.
Initial setup overhead. Despite the aim of speeding up development, initial setup and configuration of the boilerplate to suit specific project needs can slow down development initially.
Customization challenges. Tailoring a boilerplate to fit specific project requirements can sometimes be as complex as building from scratch, especially if the boilerplate is heavily opinionated.
While there are other things like performance concerns or the potential for abandonment (no updates as the tech stack improves), such things aren’t a concern for reputable SaaS boilerplates, as they will follow industry standards and offer ongoing support and updates to ensure compatibility with the latest technologies.

Still, SaaS boilerplates probably won’t be the best choice for:

Highly customized projects. Projects that require a unique set of functionalities might find boilerplates restrictive and more tedious to customize.
Developers and teams with established codebases. Devs, or teams that already have a mature development process and codebase, may find integrating a boilerplate more trouble than it’s worth.
Things to Consider When Choosing
There are several things you must ensure before choosing a SaaS boilerplate. These include:

Tech stack compatibility. The boilerplate should match your preferred tech stack; nothing can help you if you’re not comfortable here. This includes any programming languages, databases, frontend frameworks, and other technologies you need to build your SaaS project.

Reputation. It’s important to research the credibility of the SaaS boilerplate provider to ensure they have a track record of delivering quality products and support. Here, reviews and testimonials will help gauge the reliability and effectiveness of the boilerplate.

Unfortunately, most boilerplates don’t offer free trials, so you can’t check these things (except the docs) out for yourself. That’s why the creator’s credibility will be your main guiding point. Asking popular developer-centric subreddits and Discord servers about their experience regarding certain boilerplates might be worth a try too.

Finally, after you’ve completed your initial vetting, you’re good to go if the boilerplate includes the features you need and meets your budget (but some are free too!).

10 Awesome SaaS Boilerplates!
SaaS web applications are potentially a very lucrative venture, but as people say, “When everyone digs for gold, sell shovels.” There’s been a surge of SaaS boilerplates on the market, creating uncertainty regarding quality.

But there are also developers like Cory Zue (SaaS Pegasus) and Kyle Gawley (Gravity) who realized how painstaking it is to build common features every time and built a quality SaaS boilerplate for their preferred technology stack only for it to end up a major commercial success.
